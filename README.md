WeatherApp

A weather application that provides basic weather reports for today and the future forcast of 6 days.

It is built on Vite, Vue 3(using options API) & Tailwind. It also has Express.js server running. I used this for it be served on Digital Ocean.

Reasons for using Vite:
- Fast server loading
- Fast hot reloading
- Small package size

Reasons for using Vue 3:
- Goes hand in hand with Vite

Reasons for using Tailwind:
- Great customisation
- Very clean inline code
- Great documentation

How to install and run:
- Pull the repo >> git clone https://conorholgate/weather-app.git
- npm install
- npm run dev or npm start (for node js server)

Then just search for a location and have a look at the weather.
